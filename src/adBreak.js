/**
 * Client half of server-side ad insertion.
 *
 * The spot is already inside the playlist by the time the player sees it, so there
 * is nothing here that fetches an ad, and nothing a blocker can match. What this
 * module does is the bookkeeping the player cannot do without help:
 *
 *  1. ASK whether this playback carries a spot at all, and swap the source for the
 *     stitched manifest if so.
 *  2. MAP the player's timeline back to content time. This is the important one. In
 *     a stitched stream `currentTime` includes the ad, so every second of ad would
 *     otherwise be recorded as watch time against the creator's video — and the
 *     retention data the ad forecast is built from would be poisoned by the ads it
 *     sells. The break offset comes from the stitcher, because the cut lands on a
 *     segment boundary rather than on the booked second and only the server knows
 *     where that fell.
 *  3. Tell the page when the playhead is inside the break, so a Sponsored label can
 *     be shown. Disclosure is required, and a label in the player chrome is not
 *     something a filter list removes without breaking playback.
 *
 * Every failure path is silent and returns "no ad". A video must never fail to play
 * because the ad system had a bad day.
